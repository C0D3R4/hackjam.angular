# Getting started with Angular 2

[HackJam Angular 2](hackjam.hackages.io)


The goal of this second HackJam will be to learn more concepts about the framework:
- Building Component
- Link between a component and a module
- More on Property Binding
- Communication between components: Input vs Output
- A bit of architecture

You can find the [repo on Github](https://github.com/hackages/hackjam.angular.git)

Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/hackages/hackjam.angular.git`

Then you should switch to the `part-2` branch

Bootstrap your application: `npm start`

!oops

This application doesn't work :(

### Where do we start?

A live introduction from us!!

## TODO: Features to implement in your app

[Final app](http://hackjam.hackages.io)

 - Fix all the bugs before trying to implement any other features
 - Display all categories on the menu
    - Learn about structural directive
    - Learn how to create a class and create a typed array in TypeScript
 - Display all books on the main area
    - Learn about property bindings
 - On click on a category, update the list of books and change the class to selected
    - The filter should be apply to the category of the book
    - The css class should be applied to the anchor: hint [class.selected]
 - On click on the filter button, open the sidebar filter component
 - Implement the search
    - Learn about Forms and NgModel
    - The search should be applied to the title and the category
- Architecture: Split your app into small components (bonus)

Happy Coding!!
